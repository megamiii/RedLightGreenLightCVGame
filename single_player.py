# NOTE: No movement tracking yet. The single-player game currently only checks if the player is visible. 
# Consider adding a way to measure the player's movements or changes in position.
# NOTE: Define a condition that determines when the player wins 
# (e.g., reaching a certain position or surviving a set amount of time without moving during the red light phase).
# NOTE: Implement a losing condition (moving when the light is red). Don't forget to get the game over UI from the multiplayer mode.
